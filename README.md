Thanks to @supermerill for creating and updating Superslicer, the one biggest issue for lazy people is there isn't a simply way to install,update or unistall Superslicer, unless using chocolately and windowsShell.
SuperSlicerManager aim to have a simply installer that can do all the stuff listed before, using chocolately in a simply way.
Just download and run the .exe file as admin, it will check if chocolately is installed or not, and if is not installed it will install for you, easy right?

I suggest to run as administrator for file proprieties as below:

This is what you see if you don't have chocolately installed:

and this when chocolately is Installed, you won't see the prompt for install anymore

after that u can install,upgrade or unistall superslicer in a simply way when all is setup.
